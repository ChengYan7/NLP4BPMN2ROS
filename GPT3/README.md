## Experiments and selections on different functions of the GPT-3 model

In this section, we experiment with two different open functions of the GPT-3 model: search and classification. 

After comparing the pros and cons of different functions, the classification function in GPT-3 model was finally selected, where the training set is the definition and synonym text about primitives. 

In the folder "classification", there is function and initialization (upload training set) that use the classification method of GPT-3. 

In the folder "search_file", there is function and initialization (upload documents for searching) that use the search method of GPT-3. 

In the folder "search_documents", there is only a function (include documents for searching) that use the search method of GPT-3. (not so good)
